I had the pleasure of being supervised by Dr Rossella Arcucci at Imperial's Data Learning Lab. This work was also undertaken in collaboration with King's College London, specifically Professor of Econophysics Tiziana Di Matteo and PhD Researcher Giuseppe Brandi.

Thea aim of this project was to incorporate Data Assimilation and Machine Learning methods to improve time series forecasts in the financial services sector. I elected to investigate stock returns across daily, weekly and monthly intervals.
