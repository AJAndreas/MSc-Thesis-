# MSc Thesis - Data Assimilation Models for Finance 
Hi,

You have landed on the repository for my MSc thesis which is focused on using data assimilation models for financial time series prediction. I am working with Dr Rossella Arcucci, at Imperial's Data Learning Lab and in collaboration with King's College London who are kindly providing the financial data.
